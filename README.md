# skeleton-cpp-project

Skeleton C++ Project using CMake.

## Requirements

This project has the requirements below mainly because I love to stay up to date on the toolsets that I use. The versions can be lowered but the user will have to go through and figure out what needs to be updated.

* CMake 3
* Python 3
* C++11 compliant compiler such as:
 + GCC 4.8

To pass specific compiler flags to new compilers, the top-level CMakeLists.txt file will need to be updated to look for the new compilers ID.
