# skeleton-cpp-project

Skeleton C++ Project using CMake.

## Requirements

This project has the requirements below mainly because I love to stay up to date on the toolsets that I use. The versions can be lowered but the user will have to go through and figure out what needs to be updated.

* CMake 3
* Python 3
* C++11 compliant compiler such as:
 + GCC 4.8
 + Clang 3.5
 + MSVC 18.0
 + Intel 14.0

To support a new compiler, edit the `cmake/compiler_options.cmake` and add the new compiler ID along with the new compiler flags.
